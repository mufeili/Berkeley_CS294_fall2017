## Warmup

- Run `sh warm_up.sh`
- Launch the tensorboard to view the learning curve.

## Behavioral Cloning

### Part I

- Run `sh behave_clone.sh`
- Launch the tensorboard to view the learning curve.

To obtain the results for the two environments, one needs to modify the corresponding arguments in behave_clone.sh.

### Part II

This just requires changing the random seeds in behave_clone.sh.

## DAgger

- Run `sh dagger.sh`

`error_bar.py` was used for plotting error bar plots.
