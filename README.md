# Berkeley_CS294_fall2017

I intend to use this repository to organize the materials for [CS294 Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://rll.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/) offered at UC Berkeley in fall 2017. Besides the slides for the course, I also attempt to finish the [homework](https://github.com/berkeleydeeprlcourse/homework/tree/master/hw1) for the course using PyTorch.

## Requirement and Dependencies
- Python 3.5.2
- [TensorFlow 1.4.1](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [PyTorch 0.3.0.post4](http://pytorch.org/)
- [MuJuCo 1.31](http://www.mujoco.org/)
- [OpenAI Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) -- Note you also need to install [mujoco-py 0.5.7](https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py/tree/master) for Gym.
