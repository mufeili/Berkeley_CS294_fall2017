# Berkeley_CS294_fall2017

I intend to use this repository to finish the [homework](https://github.com/berkeleydeeprlcourse/homework) for the course [CS294 Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://rll.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/) offered at UC Berkeley in fall 2017 using PyTorch.

## Requirement and Dependencies
- Python 3.5.5
- [TensorFlow 1.1.0](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [PyTorch 0.4.0](http://pytorch.org/)
- [MuJuCo 1.31](http://www.mujoco.org/)
- [OpenAI Gym 0.9.3](https://github.com/openai/gym) -- Note you also need to install [mujoco-py 0.5](https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py/tree/0.5) for Gym.
- [tensorboard_logger 0.1.0](https://github.com/TeamHG-Memex/tensorboard_logger)

## Acknowledgement

I've referenced [Observerspy's implementation](https://github.com/Observerspy/CS294) as well as [PyTorch's RL examples](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/reinforcement_learning).

## Disclaimer

I've only finished the first two assignments and have been busy with many other issues since then. I cannot guarantee when this will be finished.
